## [:material-run-fast: Workshop Agenda](agenda.md)

Welcome to our workshop on generative AI and Prompt Engineering for academic research and education.

Generative AI are now deeply integrated into how we work, conduct research, teach, and learn. This workshop will introduce basic skills to effectively utilize these powerful tools, focusing on the art of crafting "prompts" — the instructions that guide AI models — and exploring how to integrate AI into daily productivity.

!!! Success "Learning Objectives"

    After this workshop, you should be able to:

    *   Identify how the workplace and classroom are being impacted by AI.
    *   Create effective prompts for leading AI models like Gemini, ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, and others.
    *   Decide when to integrate AI into your own life and work.

## [:material-run-fast: Setup](chatgpt.md)

!!! Warning "**Prerequisites**" 
    
    **We will be using Professional paid versions of GPTs for this workshop.** 
    
    If your department does not provide you with a subscription to a major GPT, or you cannot afford to purchase a monthly subscription, please contact the organizers for details about getting a demo account for the workshop.

Next, we will cover the basics of Prompt Engineering for daily productivity, as well as in academic teaching and research

!!! Info "General Productivity"

    [:material-run-fast: Go to our lesson on Daily Productivity with AI](daily-productivity.md)

    Generative AI is transforming everyday tasks. Learn how to leverage AI tools to streamline your workflows, enhance your writing, automate tasks, and boost your overall productivity. This section will likely cover:

    *   **AI-Powered Writing Assistants:**  Tools integrated into word processors, email clients, and other applications.
    *   **Smart Summarization and Note-Taking:** Using AI to quickly digest information and generate concise summaries.
    *   **Automated Task Management:**  Leveraging AI to schedule meetings, set reminders, and manage projects.

## [:material-run-fast: Education](education.md)

As the last lesson in the introductory Prompt Engineering Workshop, we will cover use cases for bringing AI into your teaching regime, into the classroom, and providing students with the ability to learn from AI as virtual tutors and teaching assistants.

!!! Info "Education"

    [:material-run-fast: AI in the Classroom](teaching.md)

    [:material-run-fast: Ethics of AI in Education](ethics.md)

    Explore the transformative potential of AI in education. Learn how to use AI to:

    *   **Personalize Learning:** Create customized learning experiences for students.
    *   **Generate Educational Content:** Develop lesson plans, quizzes, and interactive learning materials.
    *   **Provide Intelligent Tutoring:** Offer students personalized support and feedback.
    *   **Enhance Accessibility:**  Make learning more inclusive for all students.

## [:material-run-fast: Research](research.md)

We will briefly touch on the applications of AI for scientific research, primarily through the use of code interpreters and code execution using commercial software.


A future workshop on advanced uses of AI for scientific research will cover the creation and deployment of AI for science gateways and integration of custom, private, GPTs and LLMs for private and secure applications.
