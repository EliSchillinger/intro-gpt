## [:material-run-fast: Go to TBD 2025 Workshop Agenda](agenda.md)

Welcome to our workshop on generative AI and Prompt Engineering for academic research and education.

Generative AI are now deeply integrated into how we work, conduct research, teach, and learn. This workshop will introduce basic skills to effectively utilize these powerful tools, focusing on the art of crafting "prompts" — the instructions that guide AI models — and exploring how to integrate AI into daily productivity.

!!! Success "Learning Objectives"

    After this workshop, you should be able to:

    *   Identify how the workplace and classroom are being impacted by AI.
    *   Create effective prompts for leading AI models like Gemini, ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, and others.
    *   Decide when to integrate AI into your own life and work.

!!! Tip "Getting Started: Create accounts" 

    These platforms will be the primary tools used during the workshop, info on account creation here:
