## [:material-run-fast: Go to 3/18/2025 Workshop Agenda](agenda.md)

Welcome to our workshop on generative AI, and prompt engineering for academic research and education. Generative AI are now deeply integrated into how we work, conduct research, learn, and teach. 

This workshop will equip you with the basic skills to effectively utilize these powerful tools, focusing on the art of crafting "prompts" — the instructions that guide AI models — and exploring how to integrate AI into your daily work.

!!! Success "Learning Objectives"

    After this workshop, you should be able to:

    *   Explain the impacts of generative AI on academia, industry, and society.
    *   Create effective prompts for leading AI models like Gemini, ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, and others.
    *   Understand how and when to integrate AI assistants into your daily work, teaching, and research.
