## Accessing the OpenAI API

The OpenAI API allows programmatic access to models like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, DALL·E, and more, enabling integration into applications and research workflows.

**Signing up for the OpenAI API:**
1. **Open the OpenAI Platform:** Go to [https://platform.openai.com/](https://platform.openai.com/){target=_blank}.
2. **Sign up or Log in:**
    - **Sign up:** If you don’t have an OpenAI account, create one. You can reuse your ChatGPT account credentials.
    - **Log in:** If you already have an account, log in.

**Creating API Keys:**
1. **Navigate to the API Keys page:** Click on your profile icon in the top-right corner and select "View API keys."
2. **Create a new API key:** Click on "Create new secret key."
3. **Name your key (optional):** Give it a descriptive name for tracking purposes.
4. **Copy and securely store your API key:**  
   **Important:** You will not be able to view the full API key again. Store it in a password manager or a secure environment variable.

**Treat your API key like a password:** Do not share it publicly or commit it to version control platforms (like GitHub).

**Using the OpenAI API:**
- **Documentation:** Visit the [OpenAI API Reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction){target=_blank} for guidance, code examples, and model parameters.
- **Pricing:** Review the [OpenAI Pricing](https://openai.com/pricing){target=_blank} page for cost details, which are based on the number of tokens processed.
- **Rate Limits:** Familiarize yourself with [API rate limits](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits) to prevent disruptions.

!!! tip "Accessing the GPT-4 API"
    If GPT-4 API access is restricted, consider joining the waitlist: [https://openai.com/waitlist/gpt-4-api](https://openai.com/waitlist/gpt-4-api){target=_blank}.  
    Using an academic email and a clear research or educational use case can sometimes improve your chances of early access.

    **Context Windows & Token Limits:**  
    - **GPT-4 standard:** ~8,192 tokens context window.  
    - **GPT-4-32k:** ~32,768 tokens context window (~50 pages of text).  
    - **GPT-4-turbo:** Up to 128,000 tokens context window, outputting up to 4,096 tokens.

    Large context windows allow for more extensive prompt engineering and large-document analysis but can increase costs significantly. Plan your usage accordingly.
