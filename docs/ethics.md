## Controversy

 The last two years has seen a rash of cases around the mis-use and illegal applications of GPTs and LLMs.

There are [deep ethical concerns about the use of AI](https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/ai-open-letter-chatgpt-ethics/){target=_blank} like GPT and LLMs, particularly concerning their training data.

ChatGPT has effectively gamified higher education, is biased, can lie, and is being used to spread disinformation and hate speech. It also effectively steals designs, visual art, and music styles.
