## Self-Tutoring Student's Guide

Generative AI tools offer powerful new ways to enhance the learning experience both inside and outside the classroom. 

Beyond simply providing answers to prompts, GPTs can be used to interactively engage with a topic or course material, to assess your understanding, or to reflect upon materials in personal ways tailored to individual learning or study strategies. 

Access to AI unlocks new learning opportunities for disadvantaged students. For example, the use of GPTs can help English as a second language (ESL) students to work on English skills, through platforms like [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/){target=_blank}, while also conversing with them in their native language. 

The opportunity for one-on-one tutoring with AI also will enable traditionally underserved students - if they are given access to these tools by their institution. 

## Use Cases

Here's how you can use AI to become a more effective self-tutor:

??? Question "Explain Concepts"

    Struggling to grasp a difficult concept from lectures or textbooks? 
            
    Have the AI explain them to you in a way that you understand.

    !!! example "Complex ideas"
    
        === "Prompt"
     
            ```
            Explain the concept of photosynthesis in simple terms, 
            as if you were talking to a person who had never taken 
            introductory biology.
            ```
            
        === "ChatGPT o1 Response"

            Photosynthesis is like a plant’s way of making its own food using sunlight. Here’s a simple way to picture what happens:

            1. **Sunlight as an Energy Source**  
            Plants have special “solar panels” in their leaves (the green parts called chloroplasts). These panels absorb sunlight.

            2. **Taking In Raw Materials**  
            - **Carbon Dioxide**: Plants pull in a gas called carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the air through tiny holes in their leaves.  
            - **Water**: Plants also draw water (H₂O) up through their roots from the soil.

            1. **Making Food (Sugar) and Releasing Oxygen**  
            Using sunlight as energy, plants combine the carbon dioxide and water to make a type of sugar (this is like a plant’s “food”). A byproduct of this process is **oxygen**, which is released into the air.

            2. **Why It Matters**  
            - **Plants Grow and Live**: The sugar produced helps the plant grow, develop, and carry out all its functions.  
            - **We Breathe Oxygen**: The oxygen released during photosynthesis is what most living things (including humans) need to breathe.  

            In short, photosynthesis is a natural process that keeps both plants and animals alive: plants get food for themselves, and they give off oxygen for us to breathe.

        === "Gemini Pro 2.0 Response"

            Okay, imagine plants are like little chefs that make their own food. But instead of using an oven or a stove, they use sunlight! That process of making food using sunlight is called **photosynthesis**.

            Think of it like this:

            1. **Ingredients:** Plants need ingredients to make their food, just like we do. They use two main things:
                *   **Carbon dioxide:** This is a gas that's in the air all around us. We actually breathe it out when we exhale! Plants "breathe" it in through tiny holes in their leaves.
                *   **Water:** Plants drink water through their roots, like we drink with a straw.

            2. **The "Kitchen":** Inside plant leaves, there are tiny little "kitchens" called **chloroplasts**. These are special because they are green, thanks to something called **chlorophyll**. Chlorophyll is like the chef's magic tool – it can capture the energy from sunlight.

            3. **Cooking with Sunlight:**  When sunlight hits the leaves, the chlorophyll traps its energy. This energy is then used like a power source to mix the carbon dioxide and water together.

            4. **Food is Ready!** This mixing process creates a kind of sugar called **glucose**, which is the plant's food. It's like the yummy meal the plant-chef made. The plant uses this food to grow, make flowers, fruits, and all that good stuff.

            5. **Bonus – Oxygen!**  As a byproduct of this amazing food-making process, plants release **oxygen** into the air.  This is fantastic for us because we need oxygen to breathe!

            So, in a nutshell, **photosynthesis is how plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to make their own food (sugar) and release oxygen into the air.** It's like a super-efficient, solar-powered kitchen inside each leaf!

            It's a really important process because it's how plants grow, and it's also how we get the oxygen we need to live. Pretty cool, huh?                

   
    !!! example "Use analogies and metaphors" 
        
        These can make abstract ideas more relatable. 
       
        For example: 
        
        ```
        Give me an analogy to understand the concept of photosynthesis.
        ```
        
    !!! example "Explore different perspectives" 
    
        Ask the AI to explain a concept from various angles. 

        For example, 
            
        ```
        Explain the theory of evolution in plants from 
        a biological, historical, and philosophical perspective.
        ```

??? Question "Reinforcement Learning"

    **ChatGPT Prompt Writing Use Cases:** 

    !!! example  "Generate practice questions" 
    
        Specify the topic and type of question. 
        
        For example: 
        
        ```
        Create 5 multiple-choice questions about the causes 
        of World War I.``` 
        
        or 
        
        ```Give me a series of questions to prepare for 
        my final exam in the class of Calculus III```
    
    !!! example   "Get feedback on your answers" 
    
        Paste in your answers and ask for a critique. 
       
        For example: 
        
        ```
        Here's my answer to the question: [question]. 

        [answer]
        
        Is it correct, and how could I improve it?
        ```
    
    !!! example   "Create study guides and summaries"
       
        For example: 
        
        ```
        Generate a study guide for the chapter on the 
        French Revolution in my history textbook
        ``` 
    
        or 
    
        ```
        Create flashcards of the key reactions, 
        including their reactant, products and the 
        mechanism for this Organic Chemistry chapter
        ```

??? Question "Facilitated Discussion"

    **Use Case:** Want to engage in deeper discussions about the material, but study partners are unavailable?

    !!! example "Simulated debate"
        
        Take a stance on a topic and ask the AI to argue the opposing viewpoint. 
        
        For example: 
        
        ```
        I believe social media has a net positive impact on society. 
        
        Argue against this position.
        ```

    !!! example "**Explore "what if" scenarios:**" 
    
        Pose hypothetical questions to probe the material further. 
        
        For example: 
        
        ```
        What if the outcome of the American Civil War had been different? 
        
        How might history have changed?
        ```

    !!! example "**Role-play historical figures or characters:**" 
    
        For example: 
        
        ```
        Pretend you are Marie Curie, and explain your research on radioactivity 
        in a way that a non-scientist could understand.
        ```

??? Question "Enhancing Writing and Research Skills"

    **Use Case:** Struggling with essay writing, research paper organization, or finding relevant sources?

    !!! example "**Brainstorm essay topics and outlines:**"
    
        For example: 
        
        ```
        Help me brainstorm topics for an essay on the impact of climate change.
        ```
        
        or 
         
        ```
        Create an outline for a research paper on the ethical implications of artificial intelligence.
        ```
    
    !!! example "**Get feedback on your writing:**" 
    
        Paste in your draft and ask for suggestions on clarity, grammar, and style. 
        
        For example: 
        
        ```
        Review this paragraph and suggest improvements to make it more concise and impactful.
        ```
    
    !!! example "**Summarize research articles:**" 
    
        For example: 
        
        ```
        Summarize the main findings of this research article: [link to article or text of article].
        ```
        
        ```
        Please extract the key takeaways from the following report on renewable energy trends.
        ```
