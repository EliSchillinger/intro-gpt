## Self-Tutoring Student's Guide

Generative AI tools offer powerful new ways to enhance the learning experience both inside and outside the classroom. 

Beyond simply providing answers to prompts, GPTs can be used to interactively engage with a topic or course material, to assess your understanding, or to reflect upon materials in personal ways tailored to individual learning or study strategies. 

Access to AI unlocks new learning opportunities for disadvantaged students. For example, the use of GPTs can help English as a second language (ESL) students to work on English skills, through platforms like [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/){target=_blank}, while also conversing with them in their native language. 

The opportunity for one-on-one tutoring with AI also will enable traditionally underserved students - if they are given access to these tools by their institution. 

Here's how you can use AI to become a more effective self-tutor:

??? Question "Clarifying Complex Concepts"

    **ChatGPT Prompt Writing Use Cases:** 

    !!! example "Explain complex ideas"
    
        === "Prompt"
     
            Struggling to grasp a difficult concept from lectures or textbooks? 
            
            Have the AI explain them to you in a way that you understand.

            ```
            Explain the concept of photosynthesis in simple terms, 
            as if you were talking to a person who had never taken 
            introductory biology.
            ```
            
        === "ChatGPT o1 Customization on" 

            Certainly, Professor. 

            Photosynthesis is like a plant’s version of cooking its own meal. Using a special green pigment called chlorophyll, a plant takes three main ingredients—sunlight, water, and a gas called carbon dioxide—and transforms them into sugars that the plant can use for energy and growth. In the process, the plant also releases oxygen, which animals (including humans) need to breathe. 

            So, you can think of photosynthesis as nature’s way of allowing plants to feed themselves while making the air more breathable for the rest of us.

        === "ChatGPT o1 Response"

            Photosynthesis is like a plant’s way of making its own food using sunlight. Here’s a simple way to picture what happens:

            1. **Sunlight as an Energy Source**  
            Plants have special “solar panels” in their leaves (the green parts called chloroplasts). These panels absorb sunlight.

            2. **Taking In Raw Materials**  
            - **Carbon Dioxide**: Plants pull in a gas called carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the air through tiny holes in their leaves.  
            - **Water**: Plants also draw water (H₂O) up through their roots from the soil.

            1. **Making Food (Sugar) and Releasing Oxygen**  
            Using sunlight as energy, plants combine the carbon dioxide and water to make a type of sugar (this is like a plant’s “food”). A byproduct of this process is **oxygen**, which is released into the air.

            2. **Why It Matters**  
            - **Plants Grow and Live**: The sugar produced helps the plant grow, develop, and carry out all its functions.  
            - **We Breathe Oxygen**: The oxygen released during photosynthesis is what most living things (including humans) need to breathe.  

            In short, photosynthesis is a natural process that keeps both plants and animals alive: plants get food for themselves, and they give off oxygen for us to breathe.

        === "Gemini Pro 2.0 Response"

            Okay, imagine plants are like little chefs that make their own food. But instead of using an oven or a stove, they use sunlight! That process of making food using sunlight is called **photosynthesis**.

            Think of it like this:

            1. **Ingredients:** Plants need ingredients to make their food, just like we do. They use two main things:
                *   **Carbon dioxide:** This is a gas that's in the air all around us. We actually breathe it out when we exhale! Plants "breathe" it in through tiny holes in their leaves.
                *   **Water:** Plants drink water through their roots, like we drink with a straw.

            2. **The "Kitchen":** Inside plant leaves, there are tiny little "kitchens" called **chloroplasts**. These are special because they are green, thanks to something called **chlorophyll**. Chlorophyll is like the chef's magic tool – it can capture the energy from sunlight.

            3. **Cooking with Sunlight:**  When sunlight hits the leaves, the chlorophyll traps its energy. This energy is then used like a power source to mix the carbon dioxide and water together.

            4. **Food is Ready!** This mixing process creates a kind of sugar called **glucose**, which is the plant's food. It's like the yummy meal the plant-chef made. The plant uses this food to grow, make flowers, fruits, and all that good stuff.

            5. **Bonus – Oxygen!**  As a byproduct of this amazing food-making process, plants release **oxygen** into the air.  This is fantastic for us because we need oxygen to breathe!

            So, in a nutshell, **photosynthesis is how plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to make their own food (sugar) and release oxygen into the air.** It's like a super-efficient, solar-powered kitchen inside each leaf!

            It's a really important process because it's how plants grow, and it's also how we get the oxygen we need to live. Pretty cool, huh?                

   
    !!! example "Use analogies and metaphors" 
        
        These can make abstract ideas more relatable. 
       
        For example: 
        
        ```
        Give me an analogy to understand the concept of photosynthesis.
        ```
        
    !!! example "Explore different perspectives" 
    
        Ask the AI to explain a concept from various angles. 

        For example, 
            
        ```
        Explain the theory of evolution in plants from 
        a biological, historical, and philosophical perspective.
        ```

        French Revolution in my history textbook
        ``` 
    
        or

## Important Considerations

*   **Critical thinking is key:** Always critically evaluate the information provided by AI. Cross-reference with trusted sources and be aware of potential biases.
  
*   **AI is a tool, not a replacement:** Use AI to supplement your own learning efforts, not to replace them.
  
*   **Focus on understanding, not just answers:** The goal is to deepen your understanding, not just to get quick solutions.
  
*   **Prompting is an art:** The quality of the AI's response depends on the clarity and specificity of your prompts. Experiment to refine your prompting skills.

By using generative AI thoughtfully and responsibly, you can transform it into a powerful ally in your academic journey. Embrace this technology as a personalized tutor, a study partner, and a tool for self-reflection, and unlock your full learning potential.
