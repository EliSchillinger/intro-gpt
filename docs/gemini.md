## What is Gemini?

Gemini is designed to understand and generate text, code, images, audio, and video. 

While Google initially launched Bard as its conversational AI, it has since been rebranded and significantly upgraded as **Gemini**.  The Gemini models are being integrated into various Google products and services, including:

*   [**Google AI Studio:**](https://aistudio.google.com/){target=_blank} A web-based IDE for developers to prototype and build with generative AI models.
*   [**Google Search:**](https://google.com){target=_blank} Enhancing search results with AI-generated summaries and insights.
*   [**Google Workspace:**](https://workspace.google.com/solutions/ai/){target=_blank} AI features to Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Gmail, and Meet. (Similar to [Microsoft's Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/){target=_blank} integration with Office 365).
*   **Android:** [Gemini Nano](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/nano/){target=_blank} will power on-device AI features in Android devices.

!!! tip "Setting up your Gemini API Key"

    To use the Gemini API in your own applications, you'll need an API key. This key is linked to a Google Cloud project. Hereâ€™s how to set one up:

    1.  **Go to the Google Cloud Console:**
        *   Open your web browser and navigate to [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com/){target=_blank}.
        *   Sign in with your Google Account.

    2.  **Create or Select a Google Cloud Project:**
        *   At the top of the page, click the project selector dropdown menu (it might show an existing project name).
        *   In the "Select a project" window that appears, click **"New Project"**.
        *   Give your project a descriptive name (e.g., `gemini-api-project`) and click **"Create"**.

    3.  **Enable the Gemini API:**
        *   Once your project is created and selected, use the navigation menu (&#9776;) on the left to go to **"APIs & Services"** > **"Enabled APIs & services"**.
        *   Click on **"+ ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES"**.
        *   In the search bar, type `Gemini API` and press Enter.
        *   Select the **"Gemini API"** from the search results (it may also be listed as "Generative Language API").
        *   Click the **"Enable"** button. It might take a few moments to complete.

    4.  **Get Your API Key from Google AI Studio:**
        *   Now, go to [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com){target=_blank}.
        *   Click on **"Get API key"** in the top left corner.
        *   A new window will open. Click on **"Create API key in new project"** or select the project you created earlier.
        *   Your new API key will be generated and displayed. **Copy this key and store it securely.** You will need it to make calls to the Gemini API.

    Your API key is now ready to use! Remember to keep it confidential and not expose it in client-side code or public repositories.
