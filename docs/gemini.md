Google's answer to the success of ChatGPT is **Gemini**, a family of powerful multimodal AI models. Gemini is designed to understand and generate text, code, images, audio, and video. It comes in different sizes: **Gemini Ultra** (most capable), **Gemini Pro** (best for scaling across a wide range of tasks), and **Gemini Nano** (most efficient for on-device tasks).

While Google initially launched Bard as its conversational AI, it has since been rebranded and significantly upgraded as **Gemini**.  The Gemini models are being integrated into various Google products and services, including:

*   **Google AI Studio:** A web-based IDE for developers to prototype and build with generative AI models.
*   **Google Search:** Enhancing search results with AI-generated summaries and insights.
*   **Google Workspace:** Bringing AI-powered features to Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Gmail, and Meet. This is similar to Microsoft's Copilot integration with Office 365.
*   **Android:** Gemini Nano will power on-device AI features in Android devices, starting with the Pixel 8 Pro.

This guide will help you set up and get started using Google Gemini.
