## What is Gemini?

Gemini is designed to understand and generate text, code, images, audio, and video. 

While Google initially launched Bard as its conversational AI, it has since been rebranded and significantly upgraded as **Gemini**.  The Gemini models are being integrated into various Google products and services, including:

*   [**Google AI Studio:**](https://aistudio.google.com/){target=_blank} A web-based IDE for developers to prototype and build with generative AI models.
*   [**Google Search:**](https://google.com){target=_blank} Enhancing search results with AI-generated summaries and insights.
*   [**Google Workspace:**](https://workspace.google.com/solutions/ai/){target=_blank} AI features to Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Gmail, and Meet. (Similar to [Microsoft's Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/){target=_blank} integration with Office 365).
*   **Android:** [Gemini Nano](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/nano/){target=_blank} will power on-device AI features in Android devices.
