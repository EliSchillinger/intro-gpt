# Public Health Focus

Consistently, professionals point out that AI needs to overcome barriers to effective implementation:

## [:material-run-fast: Transparency & Trusted AI](../../transparency.md)

## [:material-run-fast: Bias and Data Quality](../../bias.md)

## Standardization 

Standardization of protocols and controls are also requested.

Human-in-the-loop approaches that improve accuracy and reliability

Robust AI infrastructure to allow for more seamless integration into public health practices. 

## Case Studies end Examples

### Diagnostics

AI has great promise for enhancing diagnostic capabilities, but have exhibited [biases on race and ethnicity](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/15/technology/artificial-intelligence-google-bias.html){target=_blank}. There are calls to address these biases in big data and AI for health care by taking an [open science approach](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8515002/){target=_blank}

* AI-enabled pulse oximeters overstate blood oxygen saturation in individuals with darker skin, [exacerbating racial bias](https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/algorithms-in-health-care-may-worsen-medical-racism){target=_blank}

* AI techniques for detecting skin cancer have lower accuracy on dark skin.


### Disease Surveillance & Prediction

AI-powered predictions change the landscape of population-level public health surveillance. 

Machine learning (predictive AI) has been used for many years to analyze data and make predictions around [disease spread and outbreak detection](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202504.1250/v1){target=_blank}.

### Resource Allocation

Perhaps the most ethically fraught application of AI in health care is on resource allocation. Decisions made by algorithms for high-risk care have exhibited racial biases. 

* Training data based on historical spending for health care on black vs white patients resulted in an algorithm systematically biased toward spending on more on white patients than on black patients, resulting in a perpetuation and exacerbation of the health disparity. 

### Clinical Decision Support



### Mental Health

Unregulated AI is proving to be incredibly dangerous to the mental health of vulnerable populations. The risks of AI in the mental health space cannot be overstated. AI has been accused of contributing to individuals suicide, exacerbating distress, and cyberbullying. Unlicensed and unaccountable [AI chatbots are posing as therapists](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/health/ai-therapists-chatbots.html) dispensing advice to the unaware and the desparate.

AI therapy companies are proliferating, but [there is little oversight](https://www.apaservices.org/practice/business/technology/artificial-intelligence-chatbots-therapists). Evidence of AI's effectiveness is still forthcoming, but some [early research](https://ai.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/AIoa2400802){target=_blank} and media reports on AI-powered therapists suggest AI may become a valuable tool and [help to mitigate national and rural provider shortages](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/health/ai-therapist-mental-health.html){target=_blank} for mental healthcare.
