??? Question "**Have you integrated AI into your coursework yet?**"

    !!! Failure "No, and thats OKAY!" 

        A thoughtful, wait and see, approach to incorporating AI into your educational material is rational and reasonable.

        Making the decision to incorporate an AI into your education strategy, student assessment, and grading is no easy task. 

        Further, costs and accessibility issues around AI continue to persist across academia. Underserved institutions and colleges with small budgets, or little investment into IT may not have the ability to meet security requirements needed for secure access to student's coursework or personal data (protected by FERPA).

        An important fact to consider though is that [*most* of your students are already making use of AI for their assignments and study.](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/ideas/usable-knowledge/24/09/students-are-using-ai-already-heres-what-they-think-adults-should-know){target=_blank} (ref: [:fontawesome-regular-file-pdf: Source](https://digitalthriving.gse.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Teen-and-Young-Adult-Perspectives-on-Generative-AI.pdf){target=_blank} ).

    !!! Success "Yes, but go ahead and read on"

        Thats great! 
        
        Make sure to read through the rest of this section to make sure that you're using GPTs in ways that keep your student's data and personal information safe. 
        
        Also, ensure that you're using approved AI software that has been vetted by university security and IT staff.

GPTs can compose essays and pass advanced knowledge assessments [(OpenAI :simple-arxiv:)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2303.08774){target=_blank}.  As a result, online education, a recent and lucrative innovation in academia, now faces extreme challenges regarding effective remote student assessment [(Susnjak :simple-arxiv:)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2212.09292){target=_blank}. 

Attempting to modify coursework to avoid assessment techniques where GPTs excel or using [bots to detect GPT generated content](https://platform.openai.com/ai-text-classifier){target=_blank} are increasingly proven to be futile. 

!!! Question "**Instead of engaging in a cheating arms race, why not embrace AI?**"

    Proponents of integrating AI into educational curricula [(:simple-newyorktimes:)](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/12/technology/chatgpt-schools-teachers.html){target=_blank} argue that by adapting and integrating GPTs into the curriculum, we also develop a modern workforce who are empowered by AI assistants.

## Security and FERPA Considerations for GPTs in Higher Education

The integration of GPTs into classrooms introduces challenges, particularly in terms of data security and compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). 

This section outlines key considerations for educators and administrators.

!!! Danger "FERPA Protections"

    FERPA protects the privacy of student education records. It gives parents certain rights regarding their children's education records. These rights transfer to the student at 18 years of age or beyond the high school level.

    * **Education Records:** Includes files, documents, or other materials that contain information directly related to a student and are maintained by an agency or institution of education.
    * **Directory Information:** Information contained in an education record that would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed.
    * **Rights Under FERPA:** Parents and eligible students have the right to inspect and review the student's education records, request the amendment of records they believe are inaccurate or misleading, and have some control over disclosing personally identifiable information from education records.

## Generative AI and Compliance with FERPA
    
Commercial GPTs, such as those used for creating educational content, chatbots, or data analysis tools, can potentially handle personal or sensitive information. 

**Faculty members must ensure that using these technologies complies with FERPA regulations before using them in the classroom.**

FERPA mandates the protection of student education records. 

Before using GPTs in educational settings, remember:

- Do not use student education records with Commercial or external AI tools, unless the data falls under directory information, and even then make certain you are compliant with university policy.
- When using student data, implement data minimization which anonymizes student information to avoid release of personally identifiable information (PII).
- Be extremely cautious when inputting student data into GPTs, as this can lead to unintended data leaks or exposure of PII.

### Identifying and Securing Student Data

To ensure FERPA compliance:

- Consult with your university's information technology and information security unit before using an AI software. Ensure that you only use secure, vetted, platforms that are approved by your university.  
- Do not use 3rd party software (plugins or extensions) to analyze or prompt with student data.

## Security Risks and Mitigation Strategies

### Data Leakage and Exposure

- Avoid copying sensitive emails, video/audio transcripts, or student information into GPT platforms for summarization or analysis.
- Educate all staff and teaching assistants on the risks of sharing personal or confidential information with AI systems.

### Academic Integrity

- [Develop clear policies](https://libguides.library.arizona.edu/students-chatgpt/integrity){target=_blank} on the appropriate use of AI tools for all assignments and exams. The existing [Code of Academic Integrity](https://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/policies/code-academic-integrity){target=_blank} already explains how to deal with cases of plagarism.
- Implement detection mechanisms to identify AI-generated content in student submissions.

### Technical Security Measures

- Implement zero-trust security solutions, such as secure web gateways, to control access to GPT tools.
- Use URL and content filtering to prevent unauthorized data uploads and limit access to AI platforms.

### Ethical Considerations

- Address potential equity issues arising from unequal access to AI tools among students.
- Consider the impact of AI on critical thinking skills and social interactions in the learning environment.


## Guiding Graduate Students and Postdoctoral Researchers in AI Usage

Training the next generation of researchers to use AI effectively and ethically is a crucial aspect of graduate mentorship. As an advisor, it is important to ensure that students have appropriate access to these platforms and a comprehensive understanding of the ethical implications for their education, research, and software engineering.

Platforms like ChatGPT could potentially become the primary mentor for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. Unlike human advisors, these AI systems are available 24/7 to address virtually any question or problem. However, it is essential to strike a balance between AI assistance and independent learning.

To achieve this balance, advisors should:

**Encourage AI literacy**: Provide students with resources and opportunities to learn about AI technologies, their applications, and their limitations.

**Teach responsible AI usage**: Emphasize the importance of using AI as a tool to support research, not replace critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

**Discuss ethical considerations**: Foster open discussions about the ethical implications of AI in research, including issues of bias, fairness, transparency, and accountability.

**Promote collaboration**: Encourage students to collaborate with AI, leveraging its strengths to overcome their weaknesses and vice versa.

**Stay updated**: As AI technologies continue to evolve, ensure that both advisors and students stay informed about the latest developments, best practices, and potential pitfalls.

By incorporating AI into graduate and postdoctoral training while maintaining a focus on ethics and responsibility, the next generation of researchers can harness the power of AI to advance their fields while upholding the highest standards of academic integrity.
