!!! Info  "About the Table"

    * **ChatGPT** is still the dominant chat platform as of late 2024, having recently released [model o1](https://openai.com/o1/){target=_blank} and announcing [model o3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKBG1sqdyIU){target=_blank}
    *   **LLaMA 3:** Meta's LLaMA 3 is a significant open-source model that is highly competitive and driving innovation.
    *   **Gemini:** Google's Gemini (formerly Bard) is rapidly evolving and positioned as a strong competitor to ChatGPT, particularly in multimodal capabilities.
    *   **Copilot:** Microsoft's Copilot (integrating OpenAI's technology) has become ubiquitous, especially for productivity and search.
    *   **Claude 3:** Anthropic's Claude 3 is gaining popularity due to its strong performance on reasoning tasks and commitment to AI safety.
    *   **Sora:** Although it is not yet fully accessible, OpenAI's text-to-video model has the potential to be a major innovation.
    *   **Grok:** is powered by _what might be_ the largest super computer in the world, xAI's Collossus 
    *   **Image Generation:** DALL-E 3, Stable Diffusion 3, and Midjourney v6 are leading the way in image generation, each with its strengths (photorealism, open-source nature, artistic style).
    *   **GitHub Copilot:** Remains a dominant force in code generation and is increasingly integrated into developers' workflows.

**Tip:** If you’re evaluating GPT or generative AI options, consider **security** (e.g., on-prem vs. cloud), **fine-tuning capabilities**, and **API limits** in addition to monthly cost and raw model quality.
